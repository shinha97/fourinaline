## Project Instructions
see [Project3.pdf](https://github.com/shinha97/fourinaline/blob/master/Project3.pdf)

### General Overview
> You have a 8x8 board, players take turns placing a piece on any grid. First player to get 4 in a line
(either a row, or a column; diagonals are NOT counted) wins. The maximum amount of time allowed
for generating the next move is 30 seconds. At the very beginning, your program should ask the user
for the maximum amount time (in seconds) allowed for the computer to generate the answer and
make sure that your search will stop when there's no time left. Your program should also ask the user
to decide who is going to move first.


----
## usage
1. The source code is located in the folder named 'sourcecode'. 
Inside, are the precompiled .class files, as well as the .java files.
2. Simply perform a 'java Proj3' within the directory and the program should run as expected.
3. Alternatively, the program should also run on any Java IDE. 
(Originally coded on the IntelliJ platform.)


----
## changelog
 27-Feb-2018: 

* Initialized git repository
* Began approach and algorithm design
